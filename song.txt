[Verse 1]
Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

[Verse 2]
Man, it doesn't show signs of stoppin'
And I've brought me some corn for poppin'
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow

[Bridge]
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate goin' out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home, I'll be warm
